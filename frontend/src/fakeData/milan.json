Merz is one of the most important post-war artists who brings together the corpus of his most iconic works, his igloos, dating from 1968 to his death. Mario Merz, a key figure of Arte Povera, investigates and represents the processes of the transformation of nature and human life: in particular igloos, visible reminders of primordial houses, become for the artist the archetype of inhabited places and of the world. Igloos come to represent the metaphor of the different relationships between interior and exterior, between physical space and conceptual space, and between individuality and collectivity. This exhibition offers the opportunity to observe works of historical importance and innovative scope, coming from all over from private collections and international museums. Here his works are collected and exhibited together for the first time ever in such large numbers!",

                "about": "The Tower:\nIn the 30's, the rising city built its totem in the clearing of 'Parco Sempione'. Designed by Gio Ponti, the tower is considered a true work of art in which modern architecture and new techniques meet. Slim and transparent, a true architectural challenge, it was erected in record time\u2013 just two and a half months. It was built in 1933, on the occasion of the 5th Trienniale Exhibition, along with six large isolated, temporary arches designed by Sironi. Milan gets the \"European exclusive\" of an International Triennial Exhibition of decorative, industrial arts and modern architecture.The intervention of Branca:\nHaving become unusable, the Tower was decommissioned in 1972. It has been completely restored and made accessible again by Fratelli Branca, a name it began bear in 2002. The technical data:\nAll in Dalmine pipes, made from a special steel, flanged and bolted, the Tower is 108.60 meters high. The main structure has a pyramidal-trunk shape with a hexagonal section, from a side that reaches six meters to the base. At an altitude of 100 meters, the side of the hexagon it's still 4.45 meters. The very slight taper suggests an almost prismatic appearance. Today, a modern lift system allows entrance to the indoor Belvedere Club\u2013 five people at a time, in less than one minute. The idea:\nAt the base of the renovation work, there was a will to hand over to the city of Milan, a restaurant-bar that could also host events. The Branca wanted to help awaken the pride of Milan with a unique landmark\u2013 a symbol of a new, creative and innovative effort, projected into the future. At the base of the tower there is a metal support structure, of semicircular shape, inspired by the elements of the fascinating work of monumental art meant to represent a natural technological evolution. It constitutes an axis of orientation that respects the squareness of the monumental architectures of the park (Palazzo dell' Arte, Castello, Arena and Arco della Pace) and is located at a lower level than the base, to avoid visually interfering with the monument. The beautiful casing and wall, facing the side of the park in high-strength transparent crystal, allow a suggestive perspective view of the Tower from the inside.Private events at Torre Branca:\nTorre Branca can be rented by companies and individuals for parties, corporate events and cocktails with panoramic views and exhibitions.
