Get informed, plan, book.","about":"The beautiful city of Siena in Tuscany is where you find the great Cathedral of Siena, an impressive Roman-Gothic building of the 13th century. Find your tickets here and book tickets in advance to have immediate access to the various features of the cathedral that are to be explored. By booking online you can skip the lines and save your time in order to enjoy more thoroughly the beautiful structure of the powerful Siena Cathedral will strike you with awe.This ticket will give you entrance to the Cathedral during the time of the year that allows visitors to view the Uncovering of Siena's Cathedral floor and it also permits entrance to the Piccolomini Library. There is a good selection of things to see in the Cathedral, so you may want to do some research on what most interests you and buy your tickets accordingly.The Cathedral and Uncovering of FloorThough the Cathedral of Siena is full of incredible artifacts and works of art, one of the most precious and valuable features of this structure is the floor its self. Giorgio Vasari, famous Italian artist and architect, declared that it is “the most beautiful…largest and most magnificent…that was ever made”. Designed and made between the 14th and 18th centuries it is composed of 56 panels made by famous local artists with exception of Bernardino di Betto from Umbria. The painters’ designs were made into marble flooring thanks to the marble intarsia and graffito procedures that called for a great level of investment and precision. For protection of the design and for the preservation of the art, the floor is only uncovered during a certain time of the year.Piccolomini LibraryFound within the Cathedral the Piccolomini Library was created in the beginning of the 16th century, commissioned by the patron cardinal Francesco Tedeschini Piccolomini (nephew to pope Pius II), and the artist from Umbria known as Pinturicchio, or Bernardino di Betto. The cathedral’s library is of great interest to visitors because of the artistic value of the decorations Pinturicchio provided. The painter and his workshop worked between 1503 and 1508 and quickly executed the frescoes that cover the library walls. One of the walls is occupied by windows while the remaining three seem to present a painted biography of Enea Silvio Piccolomini.","duration":"PT1H","validity":"P0D","has_price_info_on_date":true,"open":false,"ticket_not_included":false,"likely_to_sell_out":false,"special_offer":false,"exclusive":false,"best_price":false,"daily":true,"languages":[],"group_size":[],"food":[],"services":[],"features":[{"code":"istant","name":"INSTANT CONFIRMATION"}],"is_available_today":true,"is_available_tomorrow":true,"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":1,"formatted_value":"$ 1.00"},"retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"retail_price_without_service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":6,"formatted_value":"$ 6.00"},"original_retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"discount":0,"categories":[{"id":76,"name":"Attractions & monuments","level":"1","code":"attractions-and-monuments","event_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/attractions-monuments-c/"}],"reviews_number":0,"reviews_avg":0,"reviews_aggregated_info":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/siena-cathedral-with-uncovering-floor-and-piccolomini-library-545/","flavours":[],"verticals":[{"id":1,"name":"Museums & art","active":true,"code":"arts-culture","slug":"museums-art","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/museums-art-t/","meta_title":"Discover the remarkable world of Art and Museums","meta_description":"From classically beautiful renaissance paintings and sculptures to revolutionary modern artworks, admire world-renowned art with Musement.","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/vertical/0001/30/art-and-culture_header-29023.jpeg","relevance":100}],"supplier":{"uuid":"c18db8b9-2044-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","logo_url":"https://images.musement.com/default/0001/02/thumb_1969_default_header.png"},"giftable":true,"has_passenger_info":false,"has_extra_customer_data":false,"buy_multiplier":1}]},{"city_id":19,"city_obj":{"alt_cover":"https://a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/hw/location-images/city/florence_s.jpg","city_id":19,"country":"Italy","location":{"lat":43.7695604,"lng":11.2558136},"name":"Florence","population":349296},"hostel":{"cover_image_url":"https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/34.jpg","image_urls":["https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/18.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/19.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/20.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/21.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/22.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/23.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/24.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/25.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/26.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/27.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/28.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/29.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/30.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/31.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/32.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/33.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/35.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/7/7602/36.jpg"],"location":" 2km from city centre ","name":"Hostel Gallo d'Oro","price":"US$28.17","rating":"9.2","url":"https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostel-Gallo-d-Oro/Florence/7602"},"duration_in_days":"2","activities":[{"operational_days":"Everyday","max_confirmation_time":"P0D","cutoff_time":"PT4H","booking_type":"CALENDAR-TIMESLOTS","uuid":"11edc2bb-2046-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","city":{"id":2,"name":"Rome","country":{"id":82,"name":"Italy","iso_code":"IT"},"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/37/top-view-of-rome-city-skyline-from-castel-sant-angelo-jpg_header-136539.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/rome/","time_zone":"Europe/Rome"},"saves":1,"title":"Rome bike rental: one and two days","relevance":1,"relevance_venue":1,"must_see":false,"last_chance":false,"top_seller":false,"voucher_access_usage":"MOBILE","temporary":false,"description":"Book your Rome Bike Rental for one or two days with Musement.

Find your tickets here and book tickets in advance to have immediate access to the various features of the cathedral that are to be explored. By booking online you can skip the lines and save your time in order to enjoy more thoroughly the beautiful structure of the powerful Siena Cathedral will strike you with awe.This ticket will give you entrance to the Cathedral during the time of the year that allows visitors to view the Uncovering of Siena's Cathedral floor and it also permits entrance to the Piccolomini Library. There is a good selection of things to see in the Cathedral, so you may want to do some research on what most interests you and buy your tickets accordingly.The Cathedral and Uncovering of FloorThough the Cathedral of Siena is full of incredible artifacts and works of art, one of the most precious and valuable features of this structure is the floor its self. Giorgio Vasari, famous Italian artist and architect, declared that it is “the most beautiful…largest and most magnificent…that was ever made”. Designed and made between the 14th and 18th centuries it is composed of 56 panels made by famous local artists with exception of Bernardino di Betto from Umbria. The painters’ designs were made into marble flooring thanks to the marble intarsia and graffito procedures that called for a great level of investment and precision. For protection of the design and for the preservation of the art, the floor is only uncovered during a certain time of the year.Piccolomini LibraryFound within the Cathedral the Piccolomini Library was created in the beginning of the 16th century, commissioned by the patron cardinal Francesco Tedeschini Piccolomini (nephew to pope Pius II), and the artist from Umbria known as Pinturicchio, or Bernardino di Betto. The cathedral’s library is of great interest to visitors because of the artistic value of the decorations Pinturicchio provided. The painter and his workshop worked between 1503 and 1508 and quickly executed the frescoes that cover the library walls. One of the walls is occupied by windows while the remaining three seem to present a painted biography of Enea Silvio Piccolomini.","duration":"PT1H","validity":"P0D","has_price_info_on_date":true,"open":false,"ticket_not_included":false,"likely_to_sell_out":false,"special_offer":false,"exclusive":false,"best_price":false,"daily":true,"languages":[],"group_size":[],"food":[],"services":[],"features":[{"code":"istant","name":"INSTANT CONFIRMATION"}],"is_available_today":true,"is_available_tomorrow":true,"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":1,"formatted_value":"$ 1.00"},"retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"retail_price_without_service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":6,"formatted_value":"$ 6.00"},"original_retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"discount":0,"categories":[{"id":76,"name":"Attractions & monuments","level":"1","code":"attractions-and-monuments","event_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/attractions-monuments-c/"}],"reviews_number":0,"reviews_avg":0,"reviews_aggregated_info":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/siena-cathedral-with-uncovering-floor-and-piccolomini-library-545/","flavours":[],"verticals":[{"id":1,"name":"Museums & art","active":true,"code":"arts-culture","slug":"museums-art","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/museums-art-t/","meta_title":"Discover the remarkable world of Art and Museums","meta_description":"From classically beautiful renaissance paintings and sculptures to revolutionary modern artworks, admire world-renowned art with Musement.","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/vertical/0001/30/art-and-culture_header-29023.jpeg","relevance":100}],"supplier":{"uuid":"c18db8b9-2044-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","logo_url":"https://images.musement.com/default/0001/02/thumb_1969_default_header.png"},"giftable":true,"has_passenger_info":false,"has_extra_customer_data":false,"buy_multiplier":1}]},{"city_id":22,"city_obj":{"alt_cover":"https://a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/hw/location-images/country/italy_s.jpg","city_id":22,"country":"Italy","location":{"lat":42.7635254,"lng":11.1123634},"name":"Grosseto","population":60922},"hostel":{"cover_image_url":"https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/5.jpg","image_urls":["https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/ckliycemylusosrytjl8.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/dabtea1oufcmswgxx4xx.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/u005v2tlikqx4vyzwxfm.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/pfvmpomznuxmgedjeodf.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/zgremjfchpgohtzpfuxw.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/b29fgfkdp6ugz5tkukk2.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/uhmzy0bd6j1foqosdi0v.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/lksclaortxc7yu3iufb4.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/sqhgoniqkz5oqf0by4qg.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/ixv20c0rzuk5okuhdqmf.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/goyxj6saryaizpu1bt0u.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/ejlqxmvjg9qsfsvvthmi.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/cacl6tuu0f2pmwvpfsde.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/t4dz4hxivqtvbglrbjsh.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/cnfsytfo4axhfnvudg0i.jpg","https://a.hwstatic.com/propertyimages/6/6508/fit2ekckgyuqnrz3unfe.jpg"],"location":" 14km from city centre ","name":"Camping Village Le Marze","price":"US$13.57","rating":"7.4","url":"https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Camping-Village-Le-Marze/Grosseto/6508"},"duration_in_days":"4","activities":[{"operational_days":"Everyday","max_confirmation_time":"P0D","cutoff_time":"PT4H","booking_type":"CALENDAR-TIMESLOTS","uuid":"11edc2bb-2046-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","city":{"id":2,"name":"Rome","country":{"id":82,"name":"Italy","iso_code":"IT"},"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/37/top-view-of-rome-city-skyline-from-castel-sant-angelo-jpg_header-136539.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/rome/","time_zone":"Europe/Rome"},"saves":1,"title":"Rome bike rental: one and two days","relevance":1,"relevance_venue":1,"must_see":false,"last_chance":false,"top_seller":false,"voucher_access_usage":"MOBILE","temporary":false,"description":"Book your Rome Bike Rental for one or two days with Musement.

Find your tickets here and book tickets in advance to have immediate access to the various features of the cathedral that are to be explored. By booking online you can skip the lines and save your time in order to enjoy more thoroughly the beautiful structure of the powerful Siena Cathedral will strike you with awe.This ticket will give you entrance to the Cathedral during the time of the year that allows visitors to view the Uncovering of Siena's Cathedral floor and it also permits entrance to the Piccolomini Library. There is a good selection of things to see in the Cathedral, so you may want to do some research on what most interests you and buy your tickets accordingly.The Cathedral and Uncovering of FloorThough the Cathedral of Siena is full of incredible artifacts and works of art, one of the most precious and valuable features of this structure is the floor its self. Giorgio Vasari, famous Italian artist and architect, declared that it is “the most beautiful…largest and most magnificent…that was ever made”. Designed and made between the 14th and 18th centuries it is composed of 56 panels made by famous local artists with exception of Bernardino di Betto from Umbria. The painters’ designs were made into marble flooring thanks to the marble intarsia and graffito procedures that called for a great level of investment and precision. For protection of the design and for the preservation of the art, the floor is only uncovered during a certain time of the year.Piccolomini LibraryFound within the Cathedral the Piccolomini Library was created in the beginning of the 16th century, commissioned by the patron cardinal Francesco Tedeschini Piccolomini (nephew to pope Pius II), and the artist from Umbria known as Pinturicchio, or Bernardino di Betto. The cathedral’s library is of great interest to visitors because of the artistic value of the decorations Pinturicchio provided. The painter and his workshop worked between 1503 and 1508 and quickly executed the frescoes that cover the library walls. One of the walls is occupied by windows while the remaining three seem to present a painted biography of Enea Silvio Piccolomini.","duration":"PT1H","validity":"P0D","has_price_info_on_date":true,"open":false,"ticket_not_included":false,"likely_to_sell_out":false,"special_offer":false,"exclusive":false,"best_price":false,"daily":true,"languages":[],"group_size":[],"food":[],"services":[],"features":[{"code":"istant","name":"INSTANT CONFIRMATION"}],"is_available_today":true,"is_available_tomorrow":true,"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":1,"formatted_value":"$ 1.00"},"retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"retail_price_without_service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":6,"formatted_value":"$ 6.00"},"original_retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":7,"formatted_value":"$ 7.00"},"discount":0,"categories":[{"id":76,"name":"Attractions & monuments","level":"1","code":"attractions-and-monuments","event_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0003/67/thumb_266732_cover_header.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/attractions-monuments-c/"}],"reviews_number":0,"reviews_avg":0,"reviews_aggregated_info":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/siena/siena-cathedral-with-uncovering-floor-and-piccolomini-library-545/","flavours":[],"verticals":[{"id":1,"name":"Museums & art","active":true,"code":"arts-culture","slug":"museums-art","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/museums-art-t/","meta_title":"Discover the remarkable world of Art and Museums","meta_description":"From classically beautiful renaissance paintings and sculptures to revolutionary modern artworks, admire world-renowned art with Musement.","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/vertical/0001/30/art-and-culture_header-29023.jpeg","relevance":100}],"supplier":{"uuid":"c18db8b9-2044-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","logo_url":"https://images.musement.com/default/0001/02/thumb_1969_default_header.png"},"giftable":true,"has_passenger_info":false,"has_extra_customer_data":false,"buy_multiplier":1},{"operational_days":"Monday - Friday","max_confirmation_time":"PT12H","cutoff_time":"PT12H","booking_type":"CALENDAR-TIMESLOTS","uuid":"171360a6-2046-11e7-9cc9-06a7e332783f","city":{"id":339,"name":"Grosseto","country":{"id":82,"name":"Italy","iso_code":"IT"},"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0001/45/grosseto_header-44312.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/grosseto/","time_zone":"Europe/Rome"},"saves":0,"title":"Wine tasting with Morellino di Scansano at Pupille Winery","relevance":100,"relevance_venue":1,"must_see":false,"last_chance":false,"top_seller":false,"voucher_access_usage":"MOBILE","temporary":false,"description":"Discover the elegance of Maremma with a wine tasting including Morellino di Scansano, Solalto, Pelofino and other wines at the Pupille farm and winery in Grosseto.","about":"“Le Pupille is a member of The Grand Wine Tour Association: a quality brand that certifies hospitality excellence in the best wineries. The Grand Wine Tour is also a magazine online.”The history of the Pupille farm and winery dates back to the 1960's when Alfredo decided to transform a summerhouse into a typical Tuscan farmstead. This initial production of private wine grew into a larger wine-producing project in the 1980's, as the vineyards expanded to cover more of the farmland. This project had great success also thanks to the support of one of the greatest world leader in wine production, Giacomo Tachis, oenologist and father to many famous wines including Sassicaia, Solaia and Tignanello.Upon the death of its founder in 1985, the management of the farmstead enters into the hands of Elisabetta Geppetti - a young woman with a fresh and strong vision. This date marks the transition of the business from a family farmstead to a true, modern wine producing facility.The wines produced at Pupille are made unique by the winery's philosophy that mixes a well-defined respect for tradition with a contemporary vision and environmental awareness. In the wine, you will find the wisdom of the past revisited by an extremely technical and professional formula. The base of all of Pupille's products is a great elegance reflected in the extremely evolved tannins balanced also with a great freshness determined by the ideal acidity thanks to the sea breeze that reaches the vineyards spread throughout Maremma. Initially the farmland included 12 hectares of vineyards dedicated to experimenting with the Sangiovese already found on the land; over the years, however, the land has grown to include 420 hectares - 75 of which are vineyards and 20 of which are olive groves. At the farm, guests enjoy walks and picturesque scenery that can be experienced only in Maremma Tuscany.
