The Grand Wine Tour is also a magazine online.”The history of the Pupille farm and winery dates back to the 1960's when Alfredo decided to transform a summerhouse into a typical Tuscan farmstead. This initial production of private wine grew into a larger wine-producing project in the 1980's, as the vineyards expanded to cover more of the farmland. This project had great success also thanks to the support of one of the greatest world leader in wine production, Giacomo Tachis, oenologist and father to many famous wines including Sassicaia, Solaia and Tignanello.Upon the death of its founder in 1985, the management of the farmstead enters into the hands of Elisabetta Geppetti - a young woman with a fresh and strong vision.

In the wine, you will find the wisdom of the past revisited by an extremely technical and professional formula. The base of all of Pupille's products is a great elegance reflected in the extremely evolved tannins balanced also with a great freshness determined by the ideal acidity thanks to the sea breeze that reaches the vineyards spread throughout Maremma.

My name is Ruedi Gerber. I am a filmmaker at ZAS Films.\"Ruedi Gerber has crafted this place, placing every stone carefully. Likewise with filmmaking, he would like to share this experience with you.\nHe produces natural wines from indigenous, Maremma grapes - we are in Tuscany - and by re-discovering ancient varietals, in the case of red wines. The outcome is unique. Sequerciani is ideal for growing grapes for natural wine. Here 8 hectares of modern vineyards are situated 200 meters above sea level. The days are sunny and the nights fresh with gentle sea breezes, yielding grapes with the perfect level of sugar and acidity. The climate also ensures the grapes never accumulate mold. At harvest time, they carefully select only the best bunches of grapes.\nFermentation occurs by using the natural yeasts from the skins alone. They do not add external yeasts.Sequerciani wines mature in amphorae, which allow lots of oxygen and keep the flavor of the grapes. They age a small part of their red wines in wood barrels to impart hints of flavor, like spice, and mix it with the amphorae aged red before bottling.\nThis combined method gives their reds a complex flavor, whilst keeping the integrity of grapes.Sequerciani winesThey do not filter wines before bottling to let the original flavors, fragrances and colors of grapes express their true qualities.WhiteVermentinoWell-known in Italy and particularly in Tuscany, Vermentino has a good acidity and freshness with notes of citrus, white peach, and hints of white flowers.\nAged for six months in jars and wood barrels, the new harvest is available for sale in the following spring.\nOur Vermentino wine goes well with medium aged cheese, white meat, duck, and fish like salted cod, stockfish and tuna.RedFoglia TondaNamed for the first time at the end of the 19° century, it shares similar characteristics with Sangiovese, with the same power and capacity of long aging but has better flavor and greater elegance than Sangiovese. This elegant red wine is aged for 12 months in amphorae and oak barrels. It has hints of violet and spices like pepper, star anise and incense. Enjoy our Foglia Tonda with pecorino and parmesan, grilled lamb and duck.PugnitelloThis indigenous grape from Maremma was re-discovered in the early 80’s. It has a perfect connection between the body and structure of Sangiovese and flavors and aromas of Montepulciano. It is a full bodied and complex red wine, with elegance and power, personality and character, with notes of cassis, black currant and red berries such as strawberry and raspberry. After vinification, it is aged for 15 months in amphorae and oak barrels.\nPugnitello is ideal with long aged cheese, roast beef, grilled boar and wild game.","meeting_point":"Podere SEQUERCIANI • Strada Provinciale Tatti • 58023 Gavorrano (GR) +39 0566 028053","duration":"PT1H40M","validity":"P0D","has_price_info_on_date":true,"open":false,"ticket_not_included":false,"likely_to_sell_out":false,"special_offer":false,"exclusive":false,"best_price":false,"daily":false,"languages":[{"code":"en","name":"English"},{"code":"it","name":"Italian"}],"group_size":[{"code":"private","name":"Private group"}],"food":[],"services":[],"features":[{"code":"official","name":"OFFICIAL RESELLER"}],"is_available_today":false,"is_available_tomorrow":true,"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0001/63/thumb_62035_cover_header.jpeg","service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":0,"formatted_value":"$ 0.00"},"retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"retail_price_without_service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"original_retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"discount":0,"categories":[{"id":59,"name":"Food  & winery tours","level":"1","code":"food-winery-tours","event_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/07/pupille-grand-wine-tour_header-106225.jpeg","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/07/pupille-grand-wine-tour_header-106225.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/grosseto/food-winery-tours-c/"}],"reviews_number":0,"reviews_avg":0,"reviews_aggregated_info":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"latitude":42.994164,"longitude":11.015928,"url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/grosseto/natural-wine-tasting-at-sequerciani-in-maremma-tuscany-9914/","flavours":[],"verticals":[{"id":3,"name":"Food & wine","active":true,"code":"food-wine","slug":"food-wine","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/food-wine-t/","meta_title":"Delight in local Food and Wine wherever you go","meta_description":"Let Musement treat you to the wonders of the gastronomic world.

Wine tasting of local wines such as Vermentino, Foglia Tonda and Pugnitello included.","about":"“Sequerciani is my special project. It came out of a need for something solid in my virtual world. My name is Ruedi Gerber. I am a filmmaker at ZAS Films.\"Ruedi Gerber has crafted this place, placing every stone carefully. Likewise with filmmaking, he would like to share this experience with you.\nHe produces natural wines from indigenous, Maremma grapes - we are in Tuscany - and by re-discovering ancient varietals, in the case of red wines. The outcome is unique. Sequerciani is ideal for growing grapes for natural wine. Here 8 hectares of modern vineyards are situated 200 meters above sea level. The days are sunny and the nights fresh with gentle sea breezes, yielding grapes with the perfect level of sugar and acidity. The climate also ensures the grapes never accumulate mold. At harvest time, they carefully select only the best bunches of grapes.\nFermentation occurs by using the natural yeasts from the skins alone. They do not add external yeasts.Sequerciani wines mature in amphorae, which allow lots of oxygen and keep the flavor of the grapes. They age a small part of their red wines in wood barrels to impart hints of flavor, like spice, and mix it with the amphorae aged red before bottling.\nThis combined method gives their reds a complex flavor, whilst keeping the integrity of grapes.Sequerciani winesThey do not filter wines before bottling to let the original flavors, fragrances and colors of grapes express their true qualities.WhiteVermentinoWell-known in Italy and particularly in Tuscany, Vermentino has a good acidity and freshness with notes of citrus, white peach, and hints of white flowers.\nAged for six months in jars and wood barrels, the new harvest is available for sale in the following spring.\nOur Vermentino wine goes well with medium aged cheese, white meat, duck, and fish like salted cod, stockfish and tuna.RedFoglia TondaNamed for the first time at the end of the 19° century, it shares similar characteristics with Sangiovese, with the same power and capacity of long aging but has better flavor and greater elegance than Sangiovese. This elegant red wine is aged for 12 months in amphorae and oak barrels. It has hints of violet and spices like pepper, star anise and incense. Enjoy our Foglia Tonda with pecorino and parmesan, grilled lamb and duck.PugnitelloThis indigenous grape from Maremma was re-discovered in the early 80’s. It has a perfect connection between the body and structure of Sangiovese and flavors and aromas of Montepulciano. It is a full bodied and complex red wine, with elegance and power, personality and character, with notes of cassis, black currant and red berries such as strawberry and raspberry. After vinification, it is aged for 15 months in amphorae and oak barrels.\nPugnitello is ideal with long aged cheese, roast beef, grilled boar and wild game.","meeting_point":"Podere SEQUERCIANI • Strada Provinciale Tatti • 58023 Gavorrano (GR) +39 0566 028053","duration":"PT1H40M","validity":"P0D","has_price_info_on_date":true,"open":false,"ticket_not_included":false,"likely_to_sell_out":false,"special_offer":false,"exclusive":false,"best_price":false,"daily":false,"languages":[{"code":"en","name":"English"},{"code":"it","name":"Italian"}],"group_size":[{"code":"private","name":"Private group"}],"food":[],"services":[],"features":[{"code":"official","name":"OFFICIAL RESELLER"}],"is_available_today":false,"is_available_tomorrow":true,"cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0001/63/thumb_62035_cover_header.jpeg","service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":0,"formatted_value":"$ 0.00"},"retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"retail_price_without_service_fee":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"original_retail_price":{"currency":"USD","value":21,"formatted_value":"$ 21.00"},"discount":0,"categories":[{"id":59,"name":"Food  & winery tours","level":"1","code":"food-winery-tours","event_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/07/pupille-grand-wine-tour_header-106225.jpeg","cover_image_url":"https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/07/pupille-grand-wine-tour_header-106225.jpeg","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/grosseto/food-winery-tours-c/"}],"reviews_number":0,"reviews_avg":0,"reviews_aggregated_info":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"latitude":42.994164,"longitude":11.015928,"url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/grosseto/natural-wine-tasting-at-sequerciani-in-maremma-tuscany-9914/","flavours":[],"verticals":[{"id":3,"name":"Food & wine","active":true,"code":"food-wine","slug":"food-wine","url":"https://sandbox.musement.com/us/food-wine-t/","meta_title":"Delight in local Food and Wine wherever you go","meta_description":"Let Musement treat you to the wonders of the gastronomic world.
