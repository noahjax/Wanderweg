The Villa, built around a large square, extends between the Appia Antica and the Via Appia Nuova. The monumental complex, with thermal rooms, calidarium and frigidarium, overlooks terraces on the Roman countryside.

Merz is one of the most important post-war artists who brings together the corpus of his most iconic works, his igloos, dating from 1968 to his death. Mario Merz, a key figure of Arte Povera, investigates and represents the processes of the transformation of nature and human life: in particular igloos, visible reminders of primordial houses, become for the artist the archetype of inhabited places and of the world. Igloos come to represent the metaphor of the different relationships between interior and exterior, between physical space and conceptual space, and between individuality and collectivity.

                        "about": "The Tower:\nIn the 30's, the rising city built its totem in the clearing of 'Parco Sempione'. Designed by Gio Ponti, the tower is considered a true work of art in which modern architecture and new techniques meet. Slim and transparent, a true architectural challenge, it was erected in record time\u2013 just two and a half months. It was built in 1933, on the occasion of the 5th Trienniale Exhibition, along with six large isolated, temporary arches designed by Sironi. Milan gets the \"European exclusive\" of an International Triennial Exhibition of decorative, industrial arts and modern architecture.The intervention of Branca:\nHaving become unusable, the Tower was decommissioned in 1972. It has been completely restored and made accessible again by Fratelli Branca, a name it began bear in 2002. The technical data:\nAll in Dalmine pipes, made from a special steel, flanged and bolted, the Tower is 108.60 meters high. The main structure has a pyramidal-trunk shape with a hexagonal section, from a side that reaches six meters to the base. At an altitude of 100 meters, the side of the hexagon it's still 4.45 meters. The very slight taper suggests an almost prismatic appearance. Today, a modern lift system allows entrance to the indoor Belvedere Club\u2013 five people at a time, in less than one minute. The idea:\nAt the base of the renovation work, there was a will to hand over to the city of Milan, a restaurant-bar that could also host events. The Branca wanted to help awaken the pride of Milan with a unique landmark\u2013 a symbol of a new, creative and innovative effort, projected into the future. At the base of the tower there is a metal support structure, of semicircular shape, inspired by the elements of the fascinating work of monumental art meant to represent a natural technological evolution. It constitutes an axis of orientation that respects the squareness of the monumental architectures of the park (Palazzo dell' Arte, Castello, Arena and Arco della Pace) and is located at a lower level than the base, to avoid visually interfering with the monument. The beautiful casing and wall, facing the side of the park in high-strength transparent crystal, allow a suggestive perspective view of the Tower from the inside.Private events at Torre Branca:\nTorre Branca can be rented by companies and individuals for parties, corporate events and cocktails with panoramic views and exhibitions.

A unique opportunity to admire the stunning artworks displayed in the Villa's rooms and to experience the sophisticated atmosphere of the 20th-century Milanese bourgeoisie.",

Inside, visitors will discover working and interactive reproductions of Leonardo\u2019s machines, created from the famous \u201cDa Vinci Codes\u201d. The exhibition, recommended for children from 7 years old and adults alike, stimulates curiosity and promotes understanding of his remarkable work: it is organized in four sections, \u201cEarth\u201d, \u201cWater\u201d, \u201cAir\u201d and \u201cFire\u201d. All the machines have been built according to Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s designs and, where possible, to scale. In addition, there is also a section dedicated to some of Leonardo\u2019s anatomical studies and a gallery displaying his most important paintings, faithfully reproduced using high-resolution backlight technology. All exhibits are accompanied by informative descriptions in Italian, English, French, German, Spanish and Russian, and multimedia displays provide further information on Leonardo\u2019s life and works. Visitors can also browse and purchase books and souvenirs from the original and well-stocked museum shop.",

                        "about": "The Great Synagogue of Florence, one of the most important examples of Moorish architecture in Europe, was inaugurated in 1882, a few years after the Emancipation of Italian Jews in 1861, with the proclamation of Italy's unification. Its structure, different from the traditional Florentine architecture of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, has a large dome covered in green copper. The inside is particularly striking - for the richness of the geometric elements in the frescoes, the splendor of the mosaics, and the soft light that filters through the stained-glass windows. An integral part of the visit to the Synagogue is the Jewish Museum, founded in 1981 and expanded in 2007. Spread over two floors, the museum hosts a rich collection of ceremonial Jewish art objects, silverware and fabrics from the ancient synagogues of the Florentine ghetto, and photographic and archival documentation on the history of Florence's Jewish communities. On the second floor you will find objects and furnishings related to the most significant moments of the Jewish life cycle, family rituals, and religious holidays. Moreover, you will be able to visit a projection room dedicated to the memory of the Shoah (Holocaust). There is also a computer area connected to the most important Jewish museums and centers in the world.",

                        "about": "While visiting Florence you will want to stop by the 13th century Dominican Monastery of San Marco. Founded in 1436 it is today a great tourist attraction for its architectural, artistic, religious and cultural importance in the history of Florence. With this ticket you will save time and energy by skipping the lines, avoiding the hours you could possibly spend waiting for your turn at ticket-offices. With this ticket you will receive entrance to San Marco\u2019s Museum (Museo di San Marco) and have free reign to explore the halls, rooms, corridors, chapels, refectory and cloisters of the structure.San Marco\u2019s Monastery San Marco\u2019s Monastery took the place of a previously existing monastery of another order when Cosimo I de\u2019 Medici influenced the renovation and encouraged the establishment of a Dominican community in Florence. He hired the famous Italian architect Michelozzo to plan the building\u2019s renovation and today it is a great example of early 13th century architecture, with a simple, elegant and functional style that greatly reflects the standards of Renaissance design. The building remained a monastery until 1869 when a great part of the building, following some renovation, was dedicated to the Museum of Ancient Florence and later also to the monographic museum dedicated to Beato Angelico, the artist that painted the many beautiful frescoes within the monastery. San Marco\u2019s Monastery was also declared that year a \u2018monument of national importance\u2019.San Marco\u2019s MuseumThe Museum of San Marco maintains much of the atmosphere that once belonged to the Dominican convent. The great attraction of this museum is the architectural and artistic importance of the structure, particularly because of the extensive frescoes that decorate the walls of the monastery buildings. At the time in fact the extent of the decorations was greatly unusual but hoped to be a great educational tool for visitors and worshipers. Featured in the museum today is the collection of the works of Fra Angelico that were brought together at the monastery in the 20th century. Another important section of the museum is dedicated to work by Fra Bartolomeo, while another section is devoted to fragments of sculpture and architecture from buildings of central Florence that were demolished in the 19th century.",

In the old residence of the Medici family, you can visit different museums and gain access to the famous Boboli gardens.The museums included in this ticket are:\n- the Porcelain Museum\n- the Boboli Gardens\n- the Bardini Garden\nPalazzo PittiThe Palace was built by the rich Florentine banker Luca Pitti and is a Grand Renaissance building that dates back to 1458. The building is made of a rustic stone that gives it an austere but powerful look that is further reinforced by a series of arch-headed apertures, similar to ancient Roman aqueducts. Cosimo I de Medici\u2019s wife bought the building and had artist and architect Giorgio Vasari enlarge the structure to fit the family\u2019s taste, doubling it in size. Porcelain MuseumFound at the top of the Boboli Gardens in a separate building called the 'Palazzina del Cavaliere', the Porcelain Museum holds the most beautiful work of Porcelain in Europe.Boboli Gardens and Bardini GardenThe Boboli Gardens found behind Palazzo Pitti were the first example of Italian gardens that would later become so popular throughout Europe. Statues, fountains and grottoes are spread across the vast gardens, giving you the feeling that you are in an open-air museum. The nearby Bardini Garden is less famous, but unique and romantic in its arrangement as well.",

The Bargello museum is found in Palazzo Bargello in the old city and was built in 1255 to be the seat of the city\u2019s administration.Palazzo BargelloPalazzo Bargello is the name of the building that was designed by architect Lapo Tedesco. The building from administrative offices became home to the city\u2019s police force and so remained from the 16th to the 19th century. It was the center of the city\u2019s justice system and a vast area of the building became the city\u2019s prison. A great part of the Volognana Tower, part of Palazzo Bargello, was where the prisoners were mostly held. Its name is in fact the name of the first prisoner ever to be detained in its dungeons, Geri da Volognana. The tower reaches a good 57 meters and the bell on top was for centuries used to call the city\u2019s men to battle or to announce capital executions. In 1865 the first floor of Palazzo Bargello became a public museum and since then the collection has expanded and value grown exponentially. National Museum of BargelloThe National Museum of Bargello has its collection divided into various halls that each have a chronological theme generally. Each room is dedicated to a certain century and/or artist. Great artists like Michelangelo Carrand and Donatello, Andrea and Giovanni della Robbia have rooms in this museum dedicated to them and within these halls the art is theirs or of artists to them contemporary. From pre-Renaissance art to the 16th century the collection continues with displays of art of the Islamic Collection, of 15th century sculptures, bronze artifacts, paintings and objects from various historical periods made of precious elements and material.",

Book your tickets in advance here and ensure your entrance to the Chapels without wasting time at the ticket office. You can skip the line and start your exploration of the Medici tombs and chapels as soon as you arrive. This ticket will give you access to the Sagrestia Nuova (New Sacristy from the 16th century), the Chapel of the Princes, the Lorenese Crypt, and a section of the Treasure of San Lorenzo\u2019s Basilica. With this ticket you can also see temporary exhibitions.Medici ChapelsThe Medici family was one of the most powerful families in the city\u2019s history. The Basilica di San Lorenzo was built thanks to their support and the financial responsibility they took over the construction. The Sagrestia Nuova was designed by Michelangelo in the 16th century and was to be a mausoleum to members of the Medici family. The famous artist also designed many of the tombs that are found in the New Sacristy. More than 50 members of the Medici family have tombs in the New Sacristy and in the Chapel of Princes. Surmounted by a great dome, the Chapel of Princes was a true expression of court art, being the result of the collaboration of artists and lords alike.The Treasure of San Lorenzo\u2019s Basilica and the Cripta LoreneseUntil recently the Treasure of San Lorenzo was carefully preserved behind closed doors but now the underground floors of the Medici chapels have been carefully prepared to have parts of the Basilica\u2019s treasure on display. Special focus is given to some works of art that were recently restored \u2013 like the Christ by Michelozzo, a silver statue completed in the year 1444 or the Bust of Saint Peter in wood and painted gold, that dates back to 1552.\nThe Cripta Lorenese is the crypt of the Lorena family that succeeded the Medici family in the city\u2019s administrative role. They also had their family mausoleum built in the Basilica di San Lorenzo and it found in between the tomb of father Cosimo Patrie and the Medici Sepulcher.",

This incredible feat of engineering required a whole new process for its construction, which your guide will describe when you view it from inside and out. Brunelleschi's innovative approach involved vaulting the dome space without any scaffolding as he used a double shell with a space in between. Inside, the Duomo is no less impressive, with elaborate marble floors mirroring its exterior and beautiful frescos lining the dome, made by Vasari, namely the Last Judgement.Don\u2019t miss the chance to learn all about it on this guided tour with exclusive access!",
